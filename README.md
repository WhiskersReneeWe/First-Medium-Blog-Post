**First Medium Blogpost and Its Supplementary Code**

**Motivatoin**

This project demonstrates how to combine data analysis and story telling in a written form to inform the general audiences of interest.
In this project, I use simple descriptive statistics, data visualization, and a supervised Machine Learning model to answer 3 interesting questions,

1. Q1: Do guests' review habits differ between Seattle and Las Vegas?
1. Q2: What factors help a listing attract more reviews?
1. Q3: Do superhosts get price premium in general?

You can check out [my first blogpost here](https://medium.com/@reneeshiyanliu/a-naive-sleuth-on-airbnbs-cheapest-secret-weapon-user-reviews-d04f8d43555b) to learn more about what answers I find out from the data.

**Python libraries used in this project**

   - Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - ast
   - sklearn, scipy, statsmodels
   

**Data used in this project**

  - The data used are downloaded from Kaggle and AirBnB Open.
  - You can find the data source from the links below.

**Summary**

- The results suggest that people do have different review behaviors when visting Las Vegas and Seattle. The strongest factor that affects the review volume is a listing's type. The data suggests that when people enjoy enough privacy in their stay they tend to leaave reviews.
- The predictive model has a low predicting power.
- You can read more in my blogpost.
