- This is [my first blogpost](https://medium.com/@reneeshiyanliu/a-naive-sleuth-on-airbnbs-cheapest-secret-weapon-user-reviews-d04f8d43555b)
- This is a demonstration of combining data analysis and written communication to inform the general audience.
- In this demo, I use simple descriptive, data visualization, and a supervised Machine Learning model to answer 3 interesting questions.
- The data used are downloaded from Kaggle and AirBnB Open.
